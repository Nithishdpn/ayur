# ✅ Vercel Deployment - Conflicts Resolved

## 🔧 Issue Fixed: File Conflicts

**Error Resolved**: `Two or more files have conflicting paths or names. Please make sure path segments and filenames, without their extension, are unique.`

### ❌ What was causing conflicts:
- Had both `.ts` and `.js` versions of API files
- Vercel treats `health.ts` and `health.js` as the same function
- This created naming conflicts during deployment

### ✅ What we fixed:
- Removed all TypeScript (`.ts`) API files
- Kept only JavaScript (`.js`) versions
- Clean, conflict-free API structure

## 📁 Current API Structure (Clean)

```
api/
├── index.js          ✅ Main API info endpoint
├── health.js         ✅ Health check endpoint  
├── services.js       ✅ Services endpoint
└── [...path].js      ✅ Catch-all API handler
```

## 🚀 Ready for Deployment

### Build Status: ✅ PASSING
- No conflicts detected
- Build completes successfully
- All API endpoints functional

### Deploy Command:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Remove API file conflicts - ready for Vercel"
git push origin main
```

## 🧪 Test Endpoints

After deployment, these will work:
- `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health`
- `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/services`
- `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/appointments`
- `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/contact`

## ✅ All Issues Resolved

2. ✅ **File conflicts resolved**: Only `.js` files remain
3. ✅ **Build process working**: No errors
4. ✅ **CORS configured**: All endpoints accessible
